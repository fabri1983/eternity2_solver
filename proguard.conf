# Processing ComponentUI classes
# Swing UI look and feels are implemented as extensions of the ComponentUI class. 
# For some reason, these have to contain a static method createUI, which the Swing API invokes using introspection. 
# You should therefore always preserve the method as an entry point, for instance like this:
-keep class * extends javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI {
    public static javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI createUI(javax.swing.JComponent);
}

# Supress warnings and notes (only when production ready)
-dontwarn **
-dontnote **

# Uncomment if you want to have more meaningful backtraces
# Useful for obfuscation debugging
# You absolutely must keep this commented out for production
# -keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable

# This option removes all package names.
# With -adaptresourcefilenames it may cause some resource files to clash.
# If that happens, try -flattenpackagehierarchy instead
-repackageclasses
